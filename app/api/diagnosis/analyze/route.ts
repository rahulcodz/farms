- Regional climate patterns and typical weather conditions for this location
- Common diseases and pests in this region
- Local agricultural practices and available products
- Regional soil characteristics (provided below)
- Seasonal timing appropriate for this location

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. LOCATION-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS (MANDATORY):
   - ALL recommendations MUST be tailored to "${location}"
   - Consider regional climate, typical weather patterns, and seasonal conditions for this location
   - Reference common diseases and pests that occur in this region
   - Recommend products and treatments available/effective in this location
   - Consider local agricultural extension recommendations for this region

2. REGIONAL SOIL CONSIDERATION (MANDATORY):
   - Use the regional soil characteristics provided above as the baseline
   - If user-provided soil condition differs, explain how it affects the diagnosis
   - Adjust treatment recommendations based on regional soil pH, nutrient levels, and soil type
   - Consider common soil issues in this region

3. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS:
   - Base humidity and temperature assessments on typical conditions for "${location}"
   - Consider seasonal weather patterns for this location
   - Factor in regional climate risks (drought, flooding, frost, etc.)

4. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Recommend products and treatments that are available and effective in "${location}"
   - Consider local regulations and agricultural practices
   - Provide location-specific application timing based on regional growing seasons
   - Include both organic and chemical options when applicable, but prioritize what works best in this region

5. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Base your analysis on the actual images provided
   - Be realistic about timelines and expected outcomes
   - If multiple issues are detected, prioritize the most critical
   - Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text before or after

Now analyze the images and provide the diagnosis report in the exact JSON format specified above, ensuring ALL recommendations are specific to "${location}".`
